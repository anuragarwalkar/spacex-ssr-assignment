# SpaceX Launch Programs SSR App (Server Side Rendering)

I have used Next JS to build SSR , react with typescript to get less error prone code at runtime (catch error at build ) but considering time constrains I've not added typescating then I've tried to use latest JS features like Array destructuring, Object destructuring, arrow functions etc.

# Continuous Intigration And Continuous Deployment (Heroku & GitHub Actions)
Used GitHub Action to test and build the code before merging and pushing the code to the master branch and i have setup automated deployment pipeline in Heroku after detecting push to the master branch
